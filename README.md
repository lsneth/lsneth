# Current Endeavors
- Job Hunting
  - I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science and now I'm looking for a full-time software engineering position to fill. I'm most interested in a front-end position, but I'm open to learning full stack or just about anything else!
- [Mafia: Social Deduction](https://github.com/lsneth/mafia-social-deduction)
  - This is my biggest personal project so far, and the one I'm most proud of. It's also the first time I have ever created a backend of a project. It still has a ways to go, but feel free to take a look!
- Learning
  - I'm working on expanding my knowledge in React, React Native, TypeScript, and Supabase.
  - The next technologies I plan to start digging in to are Next.js and GraphQL.
